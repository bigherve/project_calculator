understand:
I am going to make a calculator using everything i've leaned so far in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all of that. Create the HTML structure for the calculator with buttons for each digit, operator, a clear button that wipes out any existing data and an “Equals” key. There should also be a display for the calculator. The calculator will contain functions for all of the basic math operators you calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items for addition, subtraction multiplication and division then create a function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers. store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key. Make a function to populate the display, once operate() has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation. Round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen. Display a error message if the user tries to divide by 0. Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 \* 3 = should yield 42.

Plan of attack:
Its a calculator so the user will interact with it through the screen and buttons simple enough. The hard part taking the users input and doing the arithmetic under the hood and returning the answer on the screen.
